# PegBoard

## Project Objective

To digitize the process of racquet sport game selection, and provide performance insights to players and club decision-makers by capturing data on game outcomes.

## Background

The current process of choosing games has not envolved since the advent of the digital era and presently involves the use of wooden ‘pegs’ on a board mounted to a wall, where present players must stand to choose games from the availiable players. Whilst this method has stood the test of time, and there is little to improve in the way of the core mechanics of game selection, it has a key drawback in that it lacks any capacity to store data about games and player performance, which could be useful in managing the club, as well as assessing personal performance.

## Technology

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.
The back-end has been created with [Express](https://expressjs.com/), using [Passport](https://www.passportjs.org/) for user authentication employing the [PassportLocal](https://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-local/) strategy.
