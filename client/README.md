# PegBoard

## Project Objective

To digitize the process of racquet sport game selection, and provide performance insights to players and club decision-makers by capturing data on game outcomes.

## Problem

The current process of choosing games next up involves the use of wooden ‘pegs’ on a board mounted to a wll. The key drawback of this classical implementation, which this project aims to resolve, is that players have to be present at the board to know where they are in the queue and take actions, such as choosing a game. It also lacks any capacity to store data about games and player performance, which could be useful in managing the club.

## Technology

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.
